# Chess-Game-With-MiniMax
#Developed by Shane Flynn
A chess game with all the standard rules that implements the MiniMax algorithm.
This was the first major project that I have worked on. Decided to do this project for fun and to gain experience working on longer term projects and learn new things along the way.
The game is visually displayed through the use of SFML.
The future goal of this project is for it to be uploaded on the cloud.
